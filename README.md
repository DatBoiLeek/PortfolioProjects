# SQL Data Exploration Project
This is a Data Analyst Portfolio project dealing with statistics & data involving COVID-19.
# Overview
The dataset used for this project comes from the website "Our World in Data" & explores the number of cases, mortalities, & vaccinations globally from January 2020 to May 2022. Scripts have been provided for, including table creation, scripts involving 
topics of interest, & scripts created for data visualizations. These files can be found in the "Covid_Project" folder. The Tableau folder contains data and spreadsheets that were exported from MySQL, and the covid project Tableau visualization. The final "covidportfolioproject_tablecreation.txt" file is a backup for the covid project table database. Lastly, the link to my Tableau public profile which contains the covid visualization can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/malik.callaham/viz/TableauCovidProjectVisualization/Dashboard1.
